.0.5 ups batts from dave, bobD
.1 excess to jonathan via BillC
BillC is on his way to seattle leaving early afternoon today, monday.
He is carrying the following, for delivery to you.

MACMINI-4507B5, mac mini,	cd0001699472
pioneer, supermicro 1U, cd0001524762
yoga, dell optiplex 745, cd0001699451
xerox phaser 6280, cd0001529302
hard disks, 6x3.5, 2x2.5
reel tapes, 2

The hard drives and reel tapes are not wiped. The mac mini hard disk is wiped seven times per DoD. 
The printer may have a hard drive embedded? i don't know. Moving printer needs a hand cart.

In an open box with the mac, tapes, disks, there is a smaller box with the UPS LAN cards marked Not For Excess.

I will start excess tickets on the items with property labels.
